Doctrine integration module for Kohana
======================================

Very simple module allowing for integration of Doctrine ORM library into the Kohana framework

 + Provides extension to Profiler in order to show Doctrine activity
 + Registers own autoloader so that Doctrine models (autogenerated) (not suffixed with _Model) will be loaded from model dirs (obeying Kohana's cascading filesystem)
 
Usage
-----

Simply place the doctrine directory in your modules dir and enable it as a module in your app configuration file

Future Work
-----------


 + Provide CLI interface for module, schema auto-generation
